Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6.

You may add Your own attribution\n    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n    as modifying the License.\n\n    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n    the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5.  Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6.

Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n    PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9.  Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

The contents\n    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n    as modifying the License.\n\n    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n    the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5.  Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6.

Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n    PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9.  Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

You may add Your own attribution\n    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n    as modifying the License.\n\n    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n    the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5.  Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9.  Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

You may add Your own attribution\n    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n    as modifying the License.\n\n    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n    the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5.  Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9.  Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

You may add Your own attribution\n    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n    as modifying the License.\n\n    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n    the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5.  Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9.  Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

You may add Your own attribution\n    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n    as modifying the License.\n\n    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n    the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5.  Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9.  Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6.  Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7.  Disclaimer of Warranty.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9.  Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

You may add Your own attribution\n    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n    as modifying the License.\n\n    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n    the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5.  Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9.  Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

The contents\n    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n    as modifying the License.\n\n    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n    the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5.  Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9.  Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

The contents\n    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n    as modifying the License.\n\n    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n    the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5.  Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9.  Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

You may add Your own attribution\n    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n    as modifying the License.\n\n    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n    the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5.  Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6.

dependencies\n2. `forge install`: install tests dependencies\n3. `forge test`: run the tests\n\nThis repository is a hybrid [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) project.\n\nFirst install the relevant dependencies of the project:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n\nforge install\n```\n\nTo compile contracts, run:\n\n```bash\nforge build\n```\n\nOr, if you prefer hardhat, you can run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat compile\n```\n\nTo run tests:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\nTo export the ABIs of the contracts in the `/contracts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat export-abi\n```\n\nTo run any scripts in the `/scripts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat run scripts/{path to the script}\n```\n\n##

dependencies\n2. `forge install`: install tests dependencies\n3. `forge test`: run the tests\n\nThis repository is a hybrid [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) project.\n\nFirst install the relevant dependencies of the project:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n\nforge install\n```\n\nTo compile contracts, run:\n\n```bash\nforge build\n```\n\nOr, if you prefer hardhat, you can run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat compile\n```\n\nTo run tests:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\nTo export the ABIs of the contracts in the `/contracts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat export-abi\n```\n\nTo run any scripts in the `/scripts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat run scripts/{path to the script}\n```\n\n##

dependencies\n2. `forge install`: install tests dependencies\n3. `forge test`: run the tests\n\nThis repository is a hybrid [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) project.\n\nFirst install the relevant dependencies of the project:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n\nforge install\n```\n\nTo compile contracts, run:\n\n```bash\nforge build\n```\n\nOr, if you prefer hardhat, you can run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat compile\n```\n\nTo run tests:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\nTo export the ABIs of the contracts in the `/contracts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat export-abi\n```\n\nTo run any scripts in the `/scripts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat run scripts/{path to the script}\n```\n\n##

install`: install tests dependencies\n3. `forge test`: run the tests\n\nThis repository is a hybrid [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) project.\n\nFirst install the relevant dependencies of the project:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n\nforge install\n```\n\nTo compile contracts, run:\n\n```bash\nforge build\n```\n\nOr, if you prefer hardhat, you can run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat compile\n```\n\nTo run tests:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\nTo export the ABIs of the contracts in the `/contracts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat export-abi\n```\n\nTo run any scripts in the `/scripts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat run scripts/{path to the script}\n```\n\n## Pre-built Contracts\n\nPre-built contracts are written by the thirdweb team, and cover the most common use cases for smart contracts.\n\nRelease pages for pre-built contracts:\n\n- [DropERC20](https://thirdweb.com/deployer.thirdweb.eth/DropERC20)\n- [DropERC721](https://thirdweb.com/deployer.thirdweb.eth/DropERC721)\n- [DropERC1155](https://thirdweb.com/deployer.thirdweb.eth/DropERC1155)\n-

contracts](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts)\n\n## Extensions\n\nExtensions are building blocks that help enrich smart contracts with features.\n\nSome blocks come packaged together as Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work. These are available at `contracts/extension/`.\n\n[Learn more about extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/extensions)\n\n## Deployments\n\nThe thirdweb registry (`TWRegistry`) and factory (`TWFactory`) have been deployed on the following chains:\n\n- [Ethereum mainnet](https://etherscan.io/)\n- [Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/)\n- [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)\n- [Polygon mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/)\n- [Polygon Mumbai testnet](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)\n- [Avalanche mainnet](https://snowtrace.io/)\n- [Avalanche Fuji testnet](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/)\n- [Fantom mainnet](https://ftmscan.com/)\n- [Fantom testnet](https://testnet.ftmscan.com/)\n\n`TWRegistry` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks. `TWFactory` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks except Fantom mainnet.\n\n- `TWRegistry`: [0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd](https://blockscan.com/address/0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd)\n\n- `TWFactory`: [0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0](https://blockscan.com/address/0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0)\n- `TWFactory` (Fantom mainnet): [0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B](https://blockscan.com/address/0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B)\n\n\n## Bug reports\n\nFound a security issue with our smart contracts?

contracts](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts)\n\n## Extensions\n\nExtensions are building blocks that help enrich smart contracts with features.\n\nSome blocks come packaged together as Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work. These are available at `contracts/extension/`.\n\n[Learn more about extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/extensions)\n\n## Deployments\n\nThe thirdweb registry (`TWRegistry`) and factory (`TWFactory`) have been deployed on the following chains:\n\n- [Ethereum mainnet](https://etherscan.io/)\n- [Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/)\n- [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)\n- [Polygon mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/)\n- [Polygon Mumbai testnet](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)\n- [Avalanche mainnet](https://snowtrace.io/)\n- [Avalanche Fuji testnet](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/)\n- [Fantom mainnet](https://ftmscan.com/)\n- [Fantom testnet](https://testnet.ftmscan.com/)\n\n`TWRegistry` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks. `TWFactory` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks except Fantom mainnet.\n\n- `TWRegistry`: [0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd](https://blockscan.com/address/0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd)\n\n- `TWFactory`: [0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0](https://blockscan.com/address/0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0)\n- `TWFactory` (Fantom mainnet): [0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B](https://blockscan.com/address/0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B)\n\n\n## Bug reports\n\nFound a security issue with our smart contracts?

Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work. These are available at `contracts/extension/`.\n\n[Learn more about extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/extensions)\n\n## Deployments\n\nThe thirdweb registry (`TWRegistry`) and factory (`TWFactory`) have been deployed on the following chains:\n\n- [Ethereum mainnet](https://etherscan.io/)\n- [Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/)\n- [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)\n- [Polygon mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/)\n- [Polygon Mumbai testnet](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)\n- [Avalanche mainnet](https://snowtrace.io/)\n- [Avalanche Fuji testnet](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/)\n- [Fantom mainnet](https://ftmscan.com/)\n- [Fantom testnet](https://testnet.ftmscan.com/)\n\n`TWRegistry` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks. `TWFactory` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks except Fantom mainnet.\n\n- `TWRegistry`: [0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd](https://blockscan.com/address/0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd)\n\n- `TWFactory`: [0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0](https://blockscan.com/address/0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0)\n- `TWFactory` (Fantom mainnet): [0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B](https://blockscan.com/address/0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B)\n\n\n## Bug reports\n\nFound a security issue with our smart contracts?

install`: install tests dependencies\n3. `forge test`: run the tests\n\nThis repository is a hybrid [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) project.\n\nFirst install the relevant dependencies of the project:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n\nforge install\n```\n\nTo compile contracts, run:\n\n```bash\nforge build\n```\n\nOr, if you prefer hardhat, you can run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat compile\n```\n\nTo run tests:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\nTo export the ABIs of the contracts in the `/contracts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat export-abi\n```\n\nTo run any scripts in the `/scripts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat run scripts/{path to the script}\n```\n\n## Pre-built Contracts\n\nPre-built contracts are written by the thirdweb team, and cover the most common use cases for smart contracts.\n\nRelease pages for pre-built contracts:\n\n- [DropERC20](https://thirdweb.com/deployer.thirdweb.eth/DropERC20)\n-

contracts](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts)\n\n## Extensions\n\nExtensions are building blocks that help enrich smart contracts with features.\n\nSome blocks come packaged together as Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work. These are available at `contracts/extension/`.\n\n[Learn more about extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/extensions)\n\n## Deployments\n\nThe thirdweb registry (`TWRegistry`) and factory (`TWFactory`) have been deployed on the following chains:\n\n- [Ethereum mainnet](https://etherscan.io/)\n- [Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/)\n- [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)\n- [Polygon mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/)\n- [Polygon Mumbai testnet](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)\n- [Avalanche mainnet](https://snowtrace.io/)\n- [Avalanche Fuji testnet](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/)\n- [Fantom mainnet](https://ftmscan.com/)\n- [Fantom testnet](https://testnet.ftmscan.com/)\n\n`TWRegistry` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks. `TWFactory` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks except Fantom mainnet.\n\n- `TWRegistry`: [0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd](https://blockscan.com/address/0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd)\n\n- `TWFactory`: [0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0](https://blockscan.com/address/0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0)\n- `TWFactory` (Fantom mainnet): [0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B](https://blockscan.com/address/0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B)\n\n\n## Bug reports\n\nFound a security issue with our smart contracts?

install`: install tests dependencies\n3. `forge test`: run the tests\n\nThis repository is a hybrid [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) project.\n\nFirst install the relevant dependencies of the project:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n\nforge install\n```\n\nTo compile contracts, run:\n\n```bash\nforge build\n```\n\nOr, if you prefer hardhat, you can run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat compile\n```\n\nTo run tests:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\nTo export the ABIs of the contracts in the `/contracts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat export-abi\n```\n\nTo run any scripts in the `/scripts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat run scripts/{path to the script}\n```\n\n## Pre-built Contracts\n\nPre-built contracts are written by the thirdweb team, and cover the most common use cases for smart contracts.\n\nRelease pages for pre-built contracts:\n\n- [DropERC20](https://thirdweb.com/deployer.thirdweb.eth/DropERC20)\n-

Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work.

install`: install tests dependencies\n3. `forge test`: run the tests\n\nThis repository is a hybrid [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) project.\n\nFirst install the relevant dependencies of the project:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n\nforge install\n```\n\nTo compile contracts, run:\n\n```bash\nforge build\n```\n\nOr, if you prefer hardhat, you can run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat compile\n```\n\nTo run tests:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\nTo export the ABIs of the contracts in the `/contracts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat export-abi\n```\n\nTo run any scripts in the `/scripts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat run scripts/{path to the script}\n```\n\n## Pre-built Contracts\n\nPre-built contracts are written by the thirdweb team, and cover the most common use cases for smart contracts.\n\nRelease pages for pre-built contracts:\n\n- [DropERC20](https://thirdweb.com/deployer.thirdweb.eth/DropERC20)\n-

Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work. These are available at `contracts/extension/`.\n\n[Learn more about extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/extensions)\n\n## Deployments\n\nThe thirdweb registry (`TWRegistry`) and factory (`TWFactory`) have been deployed on the following chains:\n\n- [Ethereum mainnet](https://etherscan.io/)\n- [Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/)\n- [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)\n- [Polygon mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/)\n- [Polygon Mumbai testnet](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)\n- [Avalanche mainnet](https://snowtrace.io/)\n- [Avalanche Fuji testnet](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/)\n- [Fantom mainnet](https://ftmscan.com/)\n- [Fantom testnet](https://testnet.ftmscan.com/)\n\n`TWRegistry` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks. `TWFactory` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks except Fantom mainnet.\n\n- `TWRegistry`: [0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd](https://blockscan.com/address/0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd)\n\n- `TWFactory`: [0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0](https://blockscan.com/address/0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0)\n- `TWFactory` (Fantom mainnet): [0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B](https://blockscan.com/address/0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B)\n\n\n## Bug reports\n\nFound a security issue with our smart contracts?

install`: install tests dependencies\n3. `forge test`: run the tests\n\nThis repository is a hybrid [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) project.\n\nFirst install the relevant dependencies of the project:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n\nforge install\n```\n\nTo compile contracts, run:\n\n```bash\nforge build\n```\n\nOr, if you prefer hardhat, you can run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat compile\n```\n\nTo run tests:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\nTo export the ABIs of the contracts in the `/contracts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat export-abi\n```\n\nTo run any scripts in the `/scripts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat run scripts/{path to the script}\n```\n\n## Pre-built Contracts\n\nPre-built contracts are written by the thirdweb team, and cover the most common use cases for smart contracts.\n\nRelease pages for pre-built contracts:\n\n- [DropERC20](https://thirdweb.com/deployer.thirdweb.eth/DropERC20)\n-

Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work.

the thirdweb SDK, dashboard and CLI</strong></p>\n<br />\n\n## Installation\n\n```shell\nnpm i @thirdweb-dev/contracts\n```\n\n## Running Tests\n\n1. `yarn`: install contracts dependencies\n2. `forge install`: install tests dependencies\n3. `forge test`: run the tests\n\nThis repository is a hybrid [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) project.\n\nFirst install the relevant dependencies of the project:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n\nforge install\n```\n\nTo compile contracts, run:\n\n```bash\nforge build\n```\n\nOr, if you prefer hardhat, you can run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat compile\n```\n\nTo run tests:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\nTo export the ABIs of the contracts in the `/contracts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat export-abi\n```\n\nTo run any scripts in the `/scripts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat run scripts/{path to the script}\n```\n\n## Pre-built Contracts\n\nPre-built contracts are written by the thirdweb team, and cover the most common use cases for smart contracts.\n\nRelease pages for pre-built contracts:\n\n- [DropERC20](https://thirdweb.com/deployer.thirdweb.eth/DropERC20)\n- [DropERC721](https://thirdweb.com/deployer.thirdweb.eth/DropERC721)\n- [DropERC1155](https://thirdweb.com/deployer.thirdweb.eth/DropERC1155)\n-

contracts](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts)\n\n## Extensions\n\nExtensions are building blocks that help enrich smart contracts with features.\n\nSome blocks come packaged together as Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work. These are available at `contracts/extension/`.\n\n[Learn more about extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/extensions)\n\n## Deployments\n\nThe thirdweb registry (`TWRegistry`) and factory (`TWFactory`) have been deployed on the following chains:\n\n- [Ethereum mainnet](https://etherscan.io/)\n- [Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/)\n- [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)\n- [Polygon mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/)\n- [Polygon Mumbai testnet](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)\n- [Avalanche mainnet](https://snowtrace.io/)\n- [Avalanche Fuji testnet](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/)\n- [Fantom mainnet](https://ftmscan.com/)\n- [Fantom testnet](https://testnet.ftmscan.com/)\n\n`TWRegistry` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks. `TWFactory` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks except Fantom mainnet.\n\n- `TWRegistry`: [0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd](https://blockscan.com/address/0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd)\n\n- `TWFactory`: [0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0](https://blockscan.com/address/0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0)\n- `TWFactory` (Fantom mainnet): [0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B](https://blockscan.com/address/0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B)\n\n\n## Bug reports\n\nFound a security issue with our smart contracts?

the thirdweb SDK, dashboard and CLI</strong></p>\n<br />\n\n## Installation\n\n```shell\nnpm i @thirdweb-dev/contracts\n```\n\n## Running Tests\n\n1. `yarn`: install contracts dependencies\n2. `forge install`: install tests dependencies\n3. `forge test`: run the tests\n\nThis repository is a hybrid [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) project.\n\nFirst install the relevant dependencies of the project:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n\nforge install\n```\n\nTo compile contracts, run:\n\n```bash\nforge build\n```\n\nOr, if you prefer hardhat, you can run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat compile\n```\n\nTo run tests:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\nTo export the ABIs of the contracts in the `/contracts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat export-abi\n```\n\nTo run any scripts in the `/scripts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat run scripts/{path to the script}\n```\n\n## Pre-built Contracts\n\nPre-built contracts are written by the thirdweb team, and cover the most common use cases for smart contracts.\n\nRelease pages for pre-built contracts:\n\n- [DropERC20](https://thirdweb.com/deployer.thirdweb.eth/DropERC20)\n-

contracts](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts)\n\n## Extensions\n\nExtensions are building blocks that help enrich smart contracts with features.\n\nSome blocks come packaged together as

Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work. These are available at `contracts/extension/`.\n\n[Learn more about extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/extensions)\n\n## Deployments\n\nThe thirdweb registry (`TWRegistry`) and factory (`TWFactory`) have been deployed on the following chains:\n\n- [Ethereum mainnet](https://etherscan.io/)\n- [Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/)\n- [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)\n- [Polygon mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/)\n- [Polygon Mumbai testnet](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)\n- [Avalanche mainnet](https://snowtrace.io/)\n- [Avalanche Fuji testnet](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/)\n- [Fantom mainnet](https://ftmscan.com/)\n- [Fantom testnet](https://testnet.ftmscan.com/)\n\n`TWRegistry` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks. `TWFactory` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks except Fantom mainnet.\n\n- `TWRegistry`: [0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd](https://blockscan.com/address/0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd)\n\n- `TWFactory`: [0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0](https://blockscan.com/address/0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0)\n- `TWFactory` (Fantom mainnet): [0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B](https://blockscan.com/address/0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B)\n\n\n## Bug reports\n\nFound a security issue with our smart contracts?

the thirdweb SDK, dashboard and CLI</strong></p>\n<br />\n\n## Installation\n\n```shell\nnpm i @thirdweb-dev/contracts\n```\n\n## Running Tests\n\n1. `yarn`: install contracts dependencies\n2. `forge install`: install tests dependencies\n3. `forge test`: run the tests\n\nThis repository is a hybrid [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) project.\n\nFirst install the relevant dependencies of the project:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n\nforge install\n```\n\nTo compile contracts, run:\n\n```bash\nforge build\n```\n\nOr, if you prefer hardhat, you can run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat compile\n```\n\nTo run tests:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\nTo export the ABIs of the contracts in the `/contracts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat export-abi\n```\n\nTo run any scripts in the `/scripts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat run scripts/{path to the script}\n```\n\n## Pre-built Contracts\n\nPre-built contracts are written by the thirdweb team, and cover the most common use cases for smart contracts.\n\nRelease pages for pre-built contracts:\n\n- [DropERC20](https://thirdweb.com/deployer.thirdweb.eth/DropERC20)\n-

contracts](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts)\n\n## Extensions\n\nExtensions are building blocks that help enrich smart contracts with features.\n\nSome blocks come packaged together as Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work. These are available at `contracts/extension/`.\n\n[Learn more about extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/extensions)\n\n## Deployments\n\nThe thirdweb registry (`TWRegistry`) and factory (`TWFactory`) have been deployed on the following chains:\n\n- [Ethereum mainnet](https://etherscan.io/)\n- [Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/)\n- [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)\n- [Polygon mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/)\n- [Polygon Mumbai testnet](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)\n- [Avalanche mainnet](https://snowtrace.io/)\n- [Avalanche Fuji testnet](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/)\n- [Fantom mainnet](https://ftmscan.com/)\n- [Fantom testnet](https://testnet.ftmscan.com/)\n\n`TWRegistry` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks. `TWFactory` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks except Fantom mainnet.\n\n- `TWRegistry`: [0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd](https://blockscan.com/address/0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd)\n\n- `TWFactory`: [0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0](https://blockscan.com/address/0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0)\n- `TWFactory` (Fantom mainnet): [0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B](https://blockscan.com/address/0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B)\n\n\n## Bug reports\n\nFound a security issue with our smart contracts?

project.\n\nFirst install the relevant dependencies of the project:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n\nforge install\n```\n\nTo compile contracts, run:\n\n```bash\nforge build\n```\n\nOr, if you prefer hardhat, you can run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat compile\n```\n\nTo run tests:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\nTo export the ABIs of the contracts in the `/contracts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat

Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work. These are available at `contracts/extension/`.\n\n[Learn more about extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/extensions)\n\n## Deployments\n\nThe thirdweb registry (`TWRegistry`) and factory (`TWFactory`) have been deployed on the following chains:\n\n- [Ethereum mainnet](https://etherscan.io/)\n- [Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/)\n- [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)\n- [Polygon mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/)\n- [Polygon Mumbai testnet](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)\n- [Avalanche mainnet](https://snowtrace.io/)\n- [Avalanche Fuji testnet](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/)\n- [Fantom mainnet](https://ftmscan.com/)\n- [Fantom testnet](https://testnet.ftmscan.com/)\n\n`TWRegistry` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks. `TWFactory` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks except Fantom mainnet.\n\n- `TWRegistry`: [0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd](https://blockscan.com/address/0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd)\n\n- `TWFactory`: [0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0](https://blockscan.com/address/0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0)\n- `TWFactory` (Fantom mainnet): [0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B](https://blockscan.com/address/0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B)\n\n\n## Bug reports\n\nFound a security issue with our smart contracts?

Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work. These are available at `contracts/extension/`.\n\n[Learn more about extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/extensions)\n\n## Deployments\n\nThe thirdweb registry (`TWRegistry`) and factory (`TWFactory`) have been deployed on the following chains:\n\n- [Ethereum mainnet](https://etherscan.io/)\n- [Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/)\n- [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)\n- [Polygon mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/)\n- [Polygon Mumbai testnet](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)\n- [Avalanche mainnet](https://snowtrace.io/)\n- [Avalanche Fuji testnet](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/)\n- [Fantom mainnet](https://ftmscan.com/)\n- [Fantom testnet](https://testnet.ftmscan.com/)\n\n`TWRegistry` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks. `TWFactory` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks except Fantom mainnet.\n\n- `TWRegistry`: [0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd](https://blockscan.com/address/0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd)\n\n- `TWFactory`: [0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0](https://blockscan.com/address/0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0)\n- `TWFactory` (Fantom mainnet): [0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B](https://blockscan.com/address/0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B)\n\n\n## Bug reports\n\nFound a security issue with our smart contracts?

install`: install tests dependencies\n3. `forge test`: run the tests\n\nThis repository is a hybrid [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) project.\n\nFirst install the relevant dependencies of the project:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n\nforge install\n```\n\nTo compile contracts, run:\n\n```bash\nforge build\n```\n\nOr, if you prefer hardhat, you can run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat compile\n```\n\nTo run tests:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\nTo export the ABIs of the contracts in the `/contracts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat export-abi\n```\n\nTo run any scripts in the `/scripts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat run scripts/{path to the script}\n```\n\n## Pre-built Contracts\n\nPre-built contracts are written by the thirdweb team, and cover the most common use cases for smart contracts.\n\nRelease pages for pre-built contracts:\n\n- [DropERC20](https://thirdweb.com/deployer.thirdweb.eth/DropERC20)\n-

contracts](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts)\n\n## Extensions\n\nExtensions are building blocks that help enrich smart contracts with features.\n\nSome blocks come packaged together as Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work. These are available at `contracts/extension/`.\n\n[Learn more about extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/extensions)\n\n## Deployments\n\nThe thirdweb registry (`TWRegistry`) and factory (`TWFactory`) have been deployed on the following chains:\n\n- [Ethereum mainnet](https://etherscan.io/)\n- [Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/)\n- [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)\n- [Polygon mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/)\n- [Polygon Mumbai testnet](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)\n- [Avalanche mainnet](https://snowtrace.io/)\n- [Avalanche Fuji testnet](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/)\n- [Fantom mainnet](https://ftmscan.com/)\n- [Fantom testnet](https://testnet.ftmscan.com/)\n\n`TWRegistry` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks. `TWFactory` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks except Fantom mainnet.\n\n- `TWRegistry`: [0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd](https://blockscan.com/address/0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd)\n\n- `TWFactory`: [0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0](https://blockscan.com/address/0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0)\n- `TWFactory` (Fantom mainnet): [0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B](https://blockscan.com/address/0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B)\n\n\n## Bug reports\n\nFound a security issue with our smart contracts?

Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work. These are available at `contracts/extension/`.\n\n[Learn more about extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/extensions)\n\n## Deployments\n\nThe thirdweb registry (`TWRegistry`) and factory (`TWFactory`) have been deployed on the following chains:\n\n- [Ethereum mainnet](https://etherscan.io/)\n- [Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/)\n- [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)\n- [Polygon mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/)\n- [Polygon Mumbai testnet](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)\n- [Avalanche mainnet](https://snowtrace.io/)\n- [Avalanche Fuji testnet](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/)\n- [Fantom mainnet](https://ftmscan.com/)\n- [Fantom testnet](https://testnet.ftmscan.com/)\n\n`TWRegistry` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks. `TWFactory` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks except Fantom mainnet.\n\n- `TWRegistry`: [0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd](https://blockscan.com/address/0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd)\n\n- `TWFactory`: [0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0](https://blockscan.com/address/0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0)\n- `TWFactory` (Fantom mainnet): [0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B](https://blockscan.com/address/0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B)\n\n\n## Bug reports\n\nFound a security issue with our smart contracts?

the thirdweb SDK, dashboard and CLI</strong></p>\n<br />\n\n## Installation\n\n```shell\nnpm i @thirdweb-dev/contracts\n```\n\n## Running Tests\n\n1. `yarn`: install contracts dependencies\n2. `forge install`: install tests dependencies\n3. `forge test`: run the tests\n\nThis repository is a hybrid [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) project.\n\nFirst install the relevant dependencies of the project:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n\nforge install\n```\n\nTo compile contracts, run:\n\n```bash\nforge build\n```\n\nOr, if you prefer hardhat, you can run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat compile\n```\n\nTo run tests:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\nTo export the ABIs of the contracts in the `/contracts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat export-abi\n```\n\nTo run any scripts in the `/scripts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat run scripts/{path to the script}\n```\n\n## Pre-built Contracts\n\nPre-built contracts are written by the thirdweb team, and cover the most common use cases for smart contracts.\n\nRelease pages for pre-built contracts:\n\n- [DropERC20](https://thirdweb.com/deployer.thirdweb.eth/DropERC20)\n-

contracts](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts)\n\n## Extensions\n\nExtensions are building blocks that help enrich smart contracts with features.\n\nSome blocks come packaged together as Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work. These are available at `contracts/extension/`.\n\n[Learn more about extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/extensions)\n\n## Deployments\n\nThe thirdweb registry (`TWRegistry`) and factory (`TWFactory`) have been deployed on the following chains:\n\n- [Ethereum mainnet](https://etherscan.io/)\n- [Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/)\n- [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)\n- [Polygon mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/)\n- [Polygon Mumbai testnet](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)\n- [Avalanche mainnet](https://snowtrace.io/)\n- [Avalanche Fuji testnet](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/)\n- [Fantom mainnet](https://ftmscan.com/)\n- [Fantom testnet](https://testnet.ftmscan.com/)\n\n`TWRegistry` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks. `TWFactory` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks except Fantom mainnet.\n\n- `TWRegistry`: [0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd](https://blockscan.com/address/0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd)\n\n- `TWFactory`: [0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0](https://blockscan.com/address/0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0)\n- `TWFactory` (Fantom mainnet): [0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B](https://blockscan.com/address/0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B)\n\n\n## Bug reports\n\nFound a security issue with our smart contracts?

install`: install tests dependencies\n3. `forge test`: run the tests\n\nThis repository is a hybrid [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) project.\n\nFirst install the relevant dependencies of the project:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n\nforge install\n```\n\nTo compile contracts, run:\n\n```bash\nforge build\n```\n\nOr, if you prefer hardhat, you can run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat compile\n```\n\nTo run tests:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\nTo export the ABIs of the contracts in the `/contracts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat export-abi\n```\n\nTo run any scripts in the `/scripts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat run scripts/{path to the script}\n```\n\n## Pre-built Contracts\n\nPre-built contracts are written by the thirdweb team, and cover the most common use cases for smart contracts.\n\nRelease pages for pre-built contracts:\n\n- [DropERC20](https://thirdweb.com/deployer.thirdweb.eth/DropERC20)\n-

contracts](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts)\n\n## Extensions\n\nExtensions are building blocks that help enrich smart contracts with features.\n\nSome blocks come packaged together as Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work. These are available at `contracts/extension/`.\n\n[Learn more about extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/extensions)\n\n## Deployments\n\nThe thirdweb registry (`TWRegistry`) and factory (`TWFactory`) have been deployed on the following chains:\n\n- [Ethereum mainnet](https://etherscan.io/)\n- [Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/)\n- [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)\n- [Polygon mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/)\n- [Polygon Mumbai testnet](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)\n- [Avalanche mainnet](https://snowtrace.io/)\n- [Avalanche Fuji testnet](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/)\n- [Fantom mainnet](https://ftmscan.com/)\n- [Fantom testnet](https://testnet.ftmscan.com/)\n\n`TWRegistry` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks. `TWFactory` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks except Fantom mainnet.\n\n- `TWRegistry`: [0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd](https://blockscan.com/address/0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd)\n\n- `TWFactory`: [0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0](https://blockscan.com/address/0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0)\n- `TWFactory` (Fantom mainnet): [0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B](https://blockscan.com/address/0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B)\n\n\n## Bug reports\n\nFound a security issue with our smart contracts?

install`: install tests dependencies\n3. `forge test`: run the tests\n\nThis repository is a hybrid [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) project.\n\nFirst install the relevant dependencies of the project:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n\nforge install\n```\n\nTo compile contracts, run:\n\n```bash\nforge build\n```\n\nOr, if you prefer hardhat, you can run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat compile\n```\n\nTo run tests:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\nTo export the ABIs of the contracts in the `/contracts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat export-abi\n```\n\nTo run any scripts in the `/scripts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat run scripts/{path to the script}\n```\n\n## Pre-built Contracts\n\nPre-built contracts are written by the thirdweb team, and cover the most common use cases for smart contracts.\n\nRelease pages for pre-built contracts:\n\n- [DropERC20](https://thirdweb.com/deployer.thirdweb.eth/DropERC20)\n-

the thirdweb SDK, dashboard and CLI</strong></p>\n<br />\n\n## Installation\n\n```shell\nnpm i @thirdweb-dev/contracts\n```\n\n## Running Tests\n\n1. `yarn`: install contracts dependencies\n2. `forge install`: install tests dependencies\n3. `forge test`: run the tests\n\nThis repository is a hybrid [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) project.\n\nFirst install the relevant dependencies of the project:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n\nforge install\n```\n\nTo compile contracts, run:\n\n```bash\nforge build\n```\n\nOr, if you prefer hardhat, you can run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat compile\n```\n\nTo run tests:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\nTo export the ABIs of the contracts in the `/contracts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat export-abi\n```\n\nTo run any scripts in the `/scripts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat run scripts/{path to the script}\n```\n\n## Pre-built Contracts\n\nPre-built contracts are written by the thirdweb team, and cover the most common use cases for smart contracts.\n\nRelease pages for pre-built contracts:\n\n- [DropERC20](https://thirdweb.com/deployer.thirdweb.eth/DropERC20)\n-

contracts](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts)\n\n## Extensions\n\nExtensions are building blocks that help enrich smart contracts with features.\n\nSome blocks come packaged together as Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work. These are available at `contracts/extension/`.\n\n[Learn more about extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/extensions)\n\n## Deployments\n\nThe thirdweb registry (`TWRegistry`) and factory (`TWFactory`) have been deployed on the following chains:\n\n- [Ethereum mainnet](https://etherscan.io/)\n- [Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/)\n- [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)\n- [Polygon mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/)\n- [Polygon Mumbai testnet](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)\n- [Avalanche mainnet](https://snowtrace.io/)\n- [Avalanche Fuji testnet](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/)\n- [Fantom mainnet](https://ftmscan.com/)\n- [Fantom testnet](https://testnet.ftmscan.com/)\n\n`TWRegistry` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks. `TWFactory` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks except Fantom mainnet.\n\n- `TWRegistry`: [0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd](https://blockscan.com/address/0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd)\n\n- `TWFactory`: [0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0](https://blockscan.com/address/0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0)\n- `TWFactory` (Fantom mainnet): [0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B](https://blockscan.com/address/0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B)\n\n\n## Bug reports\n\nFound a security issue with our smart contracts?

the thirdweb SDK, dashboard and CLI</strong></p>\n<br />\n\n## Installation\n\n```shell\nnpm i @thirdweb-dev/contracts\n```\n\n## Running Tests\n\n1. `yarn`: install contracts dependencies\n2. `forge install`: install tests dependencies\n3. `forge test`: run the tests\n\nThis repository is a hybrid [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) project.\n\nFirst install the relevant dependencies of the project:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n\nforge install\n```\n\nTo compile contracts, run:\n\n```bash\nforge build\n```\n\nOr, if you prefer hardhat, you can run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat compile\n```\n\nTo run tests:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\nTo export the ABIs of the contracts in the `/contracts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat export-abi\n```\n\nTo run any scripts in the `/scripts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat run scripts/{path to the script}\n```\n\n## Pre-built Contracts\n\nPre-built contracts are written by the thirdweb team, and cover the most common use cases for smart contracts.\n\nRelease pages for pre-built contracts:\n\n- [DropERC20](https://thirdweb.com/deployer.thirdweb.eth/DropERC20)\n- [DropERC721](https://thirdweb.com/deployer.thirdweb.eth/DropERC721)\n- [DropERC1155](https://thirdweb.com/deployer.thirdweb.eth/DropERC1155)\n-

contracts](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts)\n\n## Extensions\n\nExtensions are building blocks that help enrich smart contracts with features.\n\nSome blocks come packaged together as Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work. These are available at `contracts/extension/`.\n\n[Learn more about extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/extensions)\n\n## Deployments\n\nThe thirdweb registry (`TWRegistry`) and factory (`TWFactory`) have been deployed on the following chains:\n\n- [Ethereum mainnet](https://etherscan.io/)\n- [Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/)\n- [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)\n- [Polygon mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/)\n- [Polygon Mumbai testnet](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)\n- [Avalanche mainnet](https://snowtrace.io/)\n- [Avalanche Fuji testnet](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/)\n- [Fantom mainnet](https://ftmscan.com/)\n- [Fantom testnet](https://testnet.ftmscan.com/)\n\n`TWRegistry` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks. `TWFactory` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks except Fantom mainnet.\n\n- `TWRegistry`: [0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd](https://blockscan.com/address/0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd)\n\n- `TWFactory`: [0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0](https://blockscan.com/address/0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0)\n- `TWFactory` (Fantom mainnet): [0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B](https://blockscan.com/address/0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B)\n\n\n## Bug reports\n\nFound a security issue with our smart contracts? Send bug reports to security@thirdweb.com and we'll continue communicating with you from there. We're actively developing a bug bounty program; bug report payouts happen on a case by case basis, for now.\n\n## Feedback\n\nIf you have any feedback, please reach out to us at

Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work.

Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work.

Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work.

install`: install tests dependencies\n3. `forge test`: run the tests\n\nThis repository is a hybrid [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) project.\n\nFirst install the relevant dependencies of the project:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n\nforge install\n```\n\nTo compile contracts, run:\n\n```bash\nforge build\n```\n\nOr, if you prefer hardhat, you can run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat compile\n```\n\nTo run tests:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\nTo export the ABIs of the contracts in the `/contracts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat export-abi\n```\n\nTo run any scripts in the `/scripts` directory, run:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat run scripts/{path to the script}\n```\n\n## Pre-built Contracts\n\nPre-built contracts are written by the thirdweb team, and cover the most common use cases for smart contracts.\n\nRelease pages for pre-built contracts:\n\n- [DropERC20](https://thirdweb.com/deployer.thirdweb.eth/DropERC20)\n-

Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work. These are available at `contracts/extension/`.\n\n[Learn more about extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/extensions)\n\n## Deployments\n\nThe thirdweb registry (`TWRegistry`) and factory (`TWFactory`) have been deployed on the following chains:\n\n- [Ethereum mainnet](https://etherscan.io/)\n- [Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/)\n- [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)\n- [Polygon mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/)\n- [Polygon Mumbai testnet](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)\n- [Avalanche mainnet](https://snowtrace.io/)\n- [Avalanche Fuji testnet](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/)\n- [Fantom mainnet](https://ftmscan.com/)\n- [Fantom testnet](https://testnet.ftmscan.com/)\n\n`TWRegistry` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks. `TWFactory` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks except Fantom mainnet.\n\n- `TWRegistry`: [0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd](https://blockscan.com/address/0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd)\n\n- `TWFactory`: [0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0](https://blockscan.com/address/0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0)\n- `TWFactory` (Fantom mainnet): [0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B](https://blockscan.com/address/0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B)\n\n## Contract Audits\n\n- [Audit 1](audit-reports/audit-1.pdf)\n- [Audit 2](audit-reports/audit-2.pdf)\n- [Audit 3](audit-reports/audit-3.pdf)\n- [Audit 4](audit-reports/audit-4.pdf)\n- [Audit 5](audit-reports/audit-5.pdf)\n- [Audit 6](audit-reports/audit-6.pdf)\n- [Audit 7](audit-reports/audit-7.pdf)\n- [Audit 8](audit-reports/audit-8.pdf)\n- [Audit 9](audit-reports/audit-9.pdf)\n- [Audit 10](audit-reports/audit-10.pdf)\n- [Audit 11](audit-reports/audit-11.pdf)\n- [Audit 12](audit-reports/audit-12.pdf)\n\n## Bug reports\n\nFound a security issue with our smart contracts?

that help enrich smart contracts with features.\n\nSome blocks come packaged together as Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work.

that help enrich smart contracts with features.\n\nSome blocks come packaged together as Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work. These are available at `contracts/extension/`.\n\n[Learn more about extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/extensions)\n\n## Deployments\n\nThe thirdweb registry (`TWRegistry`) and factory (`TWFactory`) have been deployed on the following chains:\n\n- [Ethereum mainnet](https://etherscan.io/)\n- [Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/)\n- [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)\n- [Polygon mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/)\n- [Polygon Mumbai testnet](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)\n- [Avalanche mainnet](https://snowtrace.io/)\n- [Avalanche Fuji testnet](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/)\n- [Fantom mainnet](https://ftmscan.com/)\n- [Fantom testnet](https://testnet.ftmscan.com/)\n\n`TWRegistry` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks. `TWFactory` is deployed to a common address on all mentioned networks except Fantom mainnet.\n\n- `TWRegistry`: [0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd](https://blockscan.com/address/0x7c487845f98938Bb955B1D5AD069d9a30e4131fd)\n\n- `TWFactory`: [0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0](https://blockscan.com/address/0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0)\n- `TWFactory` (Fantom mainnet): [0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B](https://blockscan.com/address/0x97EA0Fcc552D5A8Fb5e9101316AAd0D62Ea0876B)\n\n## Contract Audits\n\n- [Audit 1](audit-reports/audit-1.pdf)\n- [Audit 2](audit-reports/audit-2.pdf)\n- [Audit 3](audit-reports/audit-3.pdf)\n- [Audit 4](audit-reports/audit-4.pdf)\n- [Audit 5](audit-reports/audit-5.pdf)\n- [Audit 6](audit-reports/audit-6.pdf)\n- [Audit 7](audit-reports/audit-7.pdf)\n- [Audit 8](audit-reports/audit-8.pdf)\n- [Audit 9](audit-reports/audit-9.pdf)\n- [Audit 10](audit-reports/audit-10.pdf)\n- [Audit 11](audit-reports/audit-11.pdf)\n- [Audit 12](audit-reports/audit-12.pdf)\n\n## Bug reports\n\nFound a security issue with our smart contracts?

that help enrich smart contracts with features.\n\nSome blocks come packaged together as Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work.

that help enrich smart contracts with features.\n\nSome blocks come packaged together as Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work. These are available at `contracts/extension/`.\n\n[Learn more about extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/extensions)\n\n## Contract Audits\n\n- [Audit 1](audit-reports/audit-1.pdf)\n- [Audit 2](audit-reports/audit-2.pdf)\n- [Audit 3](audit-reports/audit-3.pdf)\n- [Audit 4](audit-reports/audit-4.pdf)\n- [Audit 5](audit-reports/audit-5.pdf)\n- [Audit 6](audit-reports/audit-6.pdf)\n- [Audit 7](audit-reports/audit-7.pdf)\n- [Audit 8](audit-reports/audit-8.pdf)\n- [Audit 9](audit-reports/audit-9.pdf)\n- [Audit 10](audit-reports/audit-10.pdf)\n- [Audit 11](audit-reports/audit-11.pdf)\n- [Audit 12](audit-reports/audit-12.pdf)\n\n## Bug reports\n\nFound a security issue with our smart contracts?

that help enrich smart contracts with features.\n\nSome blocks come packaged together as Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work. These are available at `contracts/extension/`.\n\n[Learn more about extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/extensions)\n\n## Contract Audits\n\n- [Audit 1](audit-reports/audit-1.pdf)\n- [Audit 2](audit-reports/audit-2.pdf)\n- [Audit 3](audit-reports/audit-3.pdf)\n- [Audit 4](audit-reports/audit-4.pdf)\n- [Audit 5](audit-reports/audit-5.pdf)\n- [Audit 6](audit-reports/audit-6.pdf)\n- [Audit 7](audit-reports/audit-7.pdf)\n- [Audit 8](audit-reports/audit-8.pdf)\n- [Audit 9](audit-reports/audit-9.pdf)\n- [Audit 10](audit-reports/audit-10.pdf)\n- [Audit 11](audit-reports/audit-11.pdf)\n- [Audit 12](audit-reports/audit-12.pdf)\n\n## Bug reports\n\nFound a security issue with our smart contracts?

contracts dependencies\n2. `forge install`: install tests dependencies\n3. `forge test`: run the tests\n\nThis repository is a [forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) project.\n\nFirst install the relevant dependencies of the project:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n\nforge install\n```\n\nTo compile contracts, run:\n\n```bash\nforge build\n```\n\nTo run tests:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\n## Pre-built Contracts\n\nPre-built contracts are written by the thirdweb team, and cover the most common use cases for smart contracts.\n\n-

that help enrich smart contracts with features.\n\nSome blocks come packaged together as Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work. These are available at `contracts/extension/`.\n\n[Learn more about extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/extensions)\n\n## Contract Audits\n\n- [Audit 1](audit-reports/audit-1.pdf)\n- [Audit 2](audit-reports/audit-2.pdf)\n- [Audit 3](audit-reports/audit-3.pdf)\n- [Audit 4](audit-reports/audit-4.pdf)\n- [Audit 5](audit-reports/audit-5.pdf)\n- [Audit 6](audit-reports/audit-6.pdf)\n- [Audit 7](audit-reports/audit-7.pdf)\n- [Audit 8](audit-reports/audit-8.pdf)\n- [Audit 9](audit-reports/audit-9.pdf)\n- [Audit 10](audit-reports/audit-10.pdf)\n- [Audit 11](audit-reports/audit-11.pdf)\n- [Audit 12](audit-reports/audit-12.pdf)\n\n## Bug reports\n\nFound a security issue with our smart contracts?

contracts dependencies\n2. `forge install`: install tests dependencies\n3. `forge test`: run the tests\n\nThis repository is a [forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) project.\n\nFirst install the relevant dependencies of the project:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n\nforge install\n```\n\nTo compile contracts, run:\n\n```bash\nforge build\n```\n\nTo run tests:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\n## Pre-built Contracts\n\nPre-built contracts are written by the thirdweb team, and cover the most common use cases for smart contracts.\n\n-

that help enrich smart contracts with features.\n\nSome blocks come packaged together as Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work. These are available at `contracts/extension/`.\n\n[Learn more about extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/extensions)\n\n## Contract Audits\n\n- [Audit 1](audit-reports/audit-1.pdf)\n- [Audit 2](audit-reports/audit-2.pdf)\n- [Audit 3](audit-reports/audit-3.pdf)\n- [Audit 4](audit-reports/audit-4.pdf)\n- [Audit 5](audit-reports/audit-5.pdf)\n- [Audit 6](audit-reports/audit-6.pdf)\n- [Audit 7](audit-reports/audit-7.pdf)\n- [Audit 8](audit-reports/audit-8.pdf)\n- [Audit 9](audit-reports/audit-9.pdf)\n- [Audit 10](audit-reports/audit-10.pdf)\n- [Audit 11](audit-reports/audit-11.pdf)\n- [Audit 12](audit-reports/audit-12.pdf)\n\n## Bug reports\n\nFound a security issue with our smart contracts? Send bug reports to security@thirdweb.com and we'll continue communicating with you from there. We're actively developing a bug bounty program; bug report payouts happen on a case by case basis, for now.\n\n## Feedback\n\nIf you have any feedback, please reach out to us at

contracts dependencies\n2. `forge install`: install tests dependencies\n3. `forge test`: run the tests\n\nThis repository is a [forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) project.\n\nFirst install the relevant dependencies of the project:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n\nforge install\n```\n\nTo compile contracts, run:\n\n```bash\nforge build\n```\n\nTo run tests:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\n## Pre-built Contracts\n\nPre-built contracts are written by the thirdweb team, and cover the most common use cases for smart contracts.\n\n-

that help enrich smart contracts with features.\n\nSome blocks come packaged together as Base Contracts, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend. These contracts are available at `contracts/base/`.\n\nOther (smaller) blocks are Features, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract; with full customization of how those features work. These are available at `contracts/extension/`.\n\n[Learn more about extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/extensions)\n\n## Contract Audits\n\n- [Audit 1](audit-reports/audit-1.pdf)\n- [Audit 2](audit-reports/audit-2.pdf)\n- [Audit 3](audit-reports/audit-3.pdf)\n- [Audit 4](audit-reports/audit-4.pdf)\n- [Audit 5](audit-reports/audit-5.pdf)\n- [Audit 6](audit-reports/audit-6.pdf)\n- [Audit 7](audit-reports/audit-7.pdf)\n- [Audit 8](audit-reports/audit-8.pdf)\n- [Audit 9](audit-reports/audit-9.pdf)\n- [Audit 10](audit-reports/audit-10.pdf)\n- [Audit 11](audit-reports/audit-11.pdf)\n- [Audit 12](audit-reports/audit-12.pdf)\n\n## Bug reports\n\nFound a security issue with our smart contracts?
